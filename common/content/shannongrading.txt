Questions about grades. Please send any questions about grades in writing via email within two weeks after the assignment is returned. If I erred in scoring or in calculating the grade, I will happily update the record. Otherwise, I will be most receptive toward questions framed in terms of your learning (rather than simply your performance), as research has shown that focusing overly on extrinsic rewards (like grades) is likely to lead to all sorts of outcomes that I donâ€™t wish for you (lower interest in the course material, lower learning, lower enjoyment).
