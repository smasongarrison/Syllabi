Typically, an A- is defined as 90% of the highest point total in the class, B- as 80% of that total, C- as 70 and D- as 60%. I may shift these values down to provide a better fit to the actual point distribution. By scaling to a percentage of the highest point total in the class, each student has a much better chance of receiving higher grades than if no re-scaling were done. This curve can only help your grade.

The full table is provided below:
```{r}

curve_df=data.frame(
	Letter=c("A","A-","B+","B","B-","C+","C","C-","D+","D","D-"),
	Cutoff=c(0.95,0.90,0.87,0.82,0.80,0.77,0.72,0.70,0.67,0.62,0.60))

knitr::kable(
  curve_df, caption = 'Full Table'
)
```

### Curve Projections

Unsurprisingly, students have many questions about the curve in this class. For tests and other assignments, I try to provide a projected letter grade. This projected letter grade is there to give you a sense of what your score *would* be if I implemented the class curve on this particular assignment. It is a projection. It is not a guarantee. These projected letter grades are not incorporated into your final grade.

### Grading Turnaround


### Late Work
Be sure to pay close attention to deadlines. Unless you have a serious and compelling reason and instructor pre-approval, there will be no make up assignments or quizzes, or late work accepted. See the policy on excused absences for specifics.
