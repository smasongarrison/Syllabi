Typically, an A- is defined as 90% of the highest point total in the class, B- as 80% of that total, C- as 70 and D- as 60%. I may shift these values down to provide a better fit to the actual point distribution. By scaling to a percentage of the highest point total in the class, each student has a much better chance of receiving higher grades than if no re-scaling were done. This curve can only help your grade.

The full table is provided below:
```{r}

curve_df=data.frame(
	Letter=c("A","A-","B+","B","B-","C+","C","C-","D+","D","D-"),
	Cutoff=c(0.95,0.90,0.87,0.82,0.80,0.77,0.72,0.70,0.67,0.62,0.60))
