Each of us shares responsibility for the health and safety of all in a learning space. Maintaining a consistent six feet of distance; wearing a face covering; limiting our gathering sizes; and isolating or quarantining when ill or exposed to someone with the virus are Wake Forest University directives and policies we all must follow. Students are encouraged to visit the Our Way Forward website (ourwayforward.wfu.edu) to stay informed about the latest guidance and review the [Public Health Emergency Addendum to the Student Code of Conduct](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/undergraduate-student-handbook/minimum_expectations/public-health-emergency-addendum/).  

Specifically, in this room, we will mitigate the risks of virus transfer and take care of our community by abiding by the following safety directives:

- maintain six feet of distance at all times when feasible. 
- wear a face covering for the entirety of class. This face covering should cover your mouth and your nose, and adhere to [our University face covering policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hc_yL-Pzec2TdfPTgrC18Cb96vympsbI/view) (no face shields without masks; no neck gaiters; no bandanas; and no masks, including N95, with a one-way valve). 
- stay out of class when sick or after being exposed to someone who is sick.

In this class, any student who does not follow these requirements will be asked once to follow the safety directives. I will offer you a mask or ask you to find one. If you do not comply, I will ask you to leave the class for that day. [I will also refer the matter to the COVID-19 compliance reporting system.](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?WakeForestUniv&layout_id=40) Possible disciplinary actions may follow as described in the Wake Forest University Undergraduate Student Conduct Code Public Health Emergency Addendum.
