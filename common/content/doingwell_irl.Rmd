To do well in the course, you should read the assigned material before class and re-read previously assigned material as the course progresses. By reading the text before class you will be better prepared to ask questions and integrate the content of lectures with what was presented in the text. For synchronous classes, be sure to attend all lectures and arrive on time. For asynchronous classes be sure to watch all the video lectures and don't leave them until the last minute. Each topic builds directly on the previous one. Thus, if you miss one lecture, you run the risk of being completely lost in the next lecture.

In addition, many professors have implicit (*i.e.*, unspoken) expectations for college classes. I'm going to explicitly state some of those unspoken expectations. I suspect that your other professors have similar expectations -- so this information will help you in your other classes.

- Read the syllabus.
- Read all the class announcements.
- Read the FAQ and post your questions about the class there.
- Read and follow the instructions for each assignment. 
- Read your professor's comments on your submissions -- especially if you did not get full credit on that submission.
- Treat canvas messages like email.
- Read and respond to canvas messages from your professor. 
- Before you send email your professor, try to answer the question yourself by looking at the syllabus, reading the course FAQ, and reading the assignment instructions.
- Know when assignment deadlines are.
- If you need additional time or flexibility on an assignment, you communicate with your professor before the deadline passes.
