\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course provides an overview of the development and nature of
psychological tests with applications to school counseling, business,
and clinical practice. The purpose of the course is to provide students
with an understanding of the principles of measurement as applied to
group standardized measures of achievement, special aptitude,
intelligence, personality, interests and distress for use in counseling.
Format will consist primarily of lectures along with group participation
activities.

\hypertarget{course-objectives}{%
\subsection{Course Objectives:}\label{course-objectives}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To acquaint you with the fundamental vocabulary and logic of
  psychological measurement and behavioral assessment.
\item
  To develop your capacity for critical judgment of the adequacy of
  measures purported to assess behavior in the role of theory
  development.
\item
  To acquaint you with some of the relevant literature in personality
  assessment, psychometric theory and practice, and methods of observing
  and measuring behavior.
\item
  To instill in you an appreciation of and an interest in the principles
  and methods of psychometric theory in general and behavior assessment
  in particular.
\item
  This course is not designed to make you into an accomplished
  psychometrist (one who gives tests) nor is it designed to make you a
  skilled psychometrician (one who constructs tests), nor will it give
  you ``hands on'' experience with psychometric computer programs.
  Rather it is aimed to allow you to understand the fundamental
  theoretical issues concerning both the psychometrist and the
  psychometrician.
\item
  Because modern psychometrics and statistics may be done using open
  source software such as R, examples will be presented in R.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{required}{%
\subsubsection{Required}\label{required}}

{[}1{]} A. Anastasi and A. Urbina. \emph{Psychological testing}. Upper

\hypertarget{how-to-use-the-required-text}{%
\paragraph{How to use the required
text:}\label{how-to-use-the-required-text}}

The text (Anastasi and Urbina 1997) is intended to supplement the
lectures. The lectures don't follow the order of chapters in the text
and the text covers some material that won't be covered in the lectures,
i.e., not all the information in each chapter is perfectly pertinent to
the course requirements.

\hypertarget{course-assignments}{%
\section{Course Assignments}\label{course-assignments}}

\hypertarget{grading-policy}{%
\subsection{Grading Policy}\label{grading-policy}}

Typically, an A- is defined as 90\% of the highest point total in the
class, B- as 80\% of that total, C- as 70 and D- as 60\%. I may shift
these values down to provide a better fit to the actual point
distribution. By scaling to a percentage of the highest point total in
the class, each student has a much better chance of receiving higher
grades than if no re-scaling were done. This curve can only help your
grade.

The full table is provided below:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lr@{}}

\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{curve-projections}{%
\subsubsection{Curve Projections}\label{curve-projections}}

Unsurprisingly, students have many questions about the curve in this
class. For tests and other assignments, I try to provide a projected
letter grade. This projected letter grade is there to give you a sense
of what your score \emph{would} be if I implemented the class curve on
this particular assignment. It is a projection. It is not a guarantee.
These projected letter grades are not incorporated into your final
grade. Trust me, you do not want me to curve by assignment.

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\subsection{Quizzes}\label{quizzes}}

There will be 6 quizzes in this course. These will be approximately
every three weeks. The best 5 out of 6 quiz grades will be used to
determine your total quiz grade. You can drop 1 of the quizzes for any
reason.

\hypertarget{quiz-dates}{%

  Quiz 4: Friday, 04/16
\item
  Quiz 5: Friday, 05/07
\item
  Quiz 6: During Finals, 05/14
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{take-home-assignments}{%
\subsection{Take Home Assignments}\label{take-home-assignments}}

There are three large take-home assignments. Each assignment has a
qualitative aspect and a quantitative aspect, and are counted separately
in your grade.

The best two (2) out of three (3) qualitative aspects will be used to
determine your qualitative score. I will provide more specific written
guidelines at least two weeks before each assignment is due. You have to
submit assignment 1 because I give extensive feedback that will help you
on later assignments. However, you may skip assignment 2 or 3.

\hypertarget{assignment-dates}{%
\subsubsection{Assignment Dates}\label{assignment-dates}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Assignment 1: Friday, 03/05: Set 1 and Critique of an online test.
\item
  Assignment 2: Friday, 04/16: Set 2 and Critique of a testing-related
  popular media article.
\item
  Assignment 3: Friday, 05/07: Set 3 and Critique of a testing-related
  YouTube video.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{quantitative-aspects}{%
\subsubsection{Quantitative Aspects}\label{quantitative-aspects}}

The best two (2) out of three (3) sets will be used to determine your
total problem set score. You have to submit assignment 1 because I give
extensive feedback that will help you on later assignments. However, you
may skip assignment 2 or 3.You can skip one of the assignments for any
reason. However, I strongly encourage you to attempt each problem set.

\hypertarget{qualitative-aspects}{%
\subsection{Qualitative Aspects}\label{qualitative-aspects}}

These qualitative assignments will allow you to incorporate some of your
own interests into the course. Such interests could be related to your
career, another class you're taking, a hobby you're exploring, or some
other random fancy. They will typically be approximately two (2) pages.

The best two (2) out of three (3) qualitative assignments will be used
to determine your total qualitative assignment score. You have to submit
assignment 1 because I give extensive feedback that will help you on
later assignments. However, you may skip assignment 2 or 3.

\hypertarget{engagement-activities}{%
\subsection{Engagement Activities}\label{engagement-activities}}

There will be multiple engagement activities in this course. These
activities will allow you engage with the material for each module.
Details about the specific activities will be provided on canvas.
Students must complete two activities per module.

\hypertarget{grading-weighting}{%
\subsection{Grading Weighting}\label{grading-weighting}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  150 points of your grade will be determined by your best five (5)
  quizzes.
\item
  100 points of your grade will be determined by your best two (2)
  problem sets.
\item
  100 points of your grade will be determined by your best two (2)
  writing assignments.
\item
  50 points of your grade will be determined by your engagement.

\hypertarget{course-policies}{%
\section{Course Policies}\label{course-policies}}

\hypertarget{class-engagement-presence-and-participation.}{%
\subsection{Class Engagement, Presence, and
Participation.}\label{class-engagement-presence-and-participation.}}

In previous semesters, I have had a deliberately hardline attendance
policy. In the light of the public health crisis, I have done away with
the this policy, as it doesn't align with my general philosophy of
treating students as junior colleagues. The student who misses a class
meeting is responsible for any assignments and/or announcements made.

Class engagement points are given to encourage your active engagement
with the material. Specific instructions for engagement, can be found on
Canvas. In general, you will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as
you engage meaningfully and intentionally with the material and your
peers.

\hypertarget{life-happens-extensions-and-absences}{%
\subsection{Life Happens (Extensions and
Absences)}\label{life-happens-extensions-and-absences}}

As a reasonable and empathetic human, I recognize that life happens.
There will be times when your outside life conflicts with scheduled
class events. These life events can be any of the obvious things
(sports, religious holidays, illness, interviews, etc), but they can
also be the less obvious, like spending the entire night looking for
your lost pet. My general approach is to work with you. You just need to
let me know \emph{ahead} of time. These late policies value discussion
and communication over deductions and punishment. It is difficult for me
as an instructor to know your situation and reason for lateness
(e.g.~are you sick? did you lose wifi? struggling with mental health? or
just forgot?). Without communication, I will assume that students are
choosing not to submit work and do not plan on submitting work. An email
will help me better understand your needs and focus on coursework. I'm
more than happy to give extensions and accommodations, so don't be
afraid to email me. You don't need to disclose personal details (your
privacy is important to me), so a heads up or request for assistance is
enough.

\hypertarget{excused-absences}{%
\subsubsection{Excused absences}\label{excused-absences}}

Except in the case of \emph{true} emergencies, a possible excused
absence should be discussed with me as far in advance as possible and
\emph{must} occur beforehand. You should not assume that an excused
absence will automatically be granted -- but you may assume that I am a
reasonable, empathetic person. This discussion should occur via email.
If you also discuss your situation verbally, please send a summary of
the discussion via email to me. An unexcused absence will result in a
zero for any graded work that should have been performed for or during
the missed class.

\hypertarget{late-work}{%
\subsubsection{Late Work}\label{late-work}}

Be sure to pay close attention to deadlines. If an assignment is not
submitted by the deadline (i.e., is late), the student must email the
instructor and provide a new deadline, ask for an alternative, or
explain concerns \emph{within 36 hours} of the missed deadline. Ideally,
you will have communicated with me in advance of the deadline, but on
occasion life happens. As long as you've communicated \emph{within 36
hours}, I will do my best to work with you to come up with a new
deadline or modification, so that you can receive full credit. This late
policy does not apply to exams, tests, or quizzes.

If contact is not made \emph{within 36 hours} of the missed deadline,
the missing assignment will receive a 0. Alternative deadlines will be
within one week of the original deadline. Exceptions to the 1 week
policy are at the instructor's discretion. In general, I will be much
more sympathetic and accommodating if you communicate in advance.

It is your responsibility to ensure that the instructor has received the
assignment by the established due date and to ensure that the assignment
submitted is the complete and correct version. Unless otherwise
specified, all work must be submitted through Canvas.

Unless you have communicated with me in advance, there will be no
make-up quizzes or tests.

\hypertarget{accommodations-policy}{%
\subsection{Accommodations Policy}\label{accommodations-policy}}

If you are (or become) disabled (in any capacity, permanently, or
temporarily), and need accommodations in class, reading, or any other
work in this course, please contact me to discuss your specific needs as
soon as possible. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, you are
legally entitled to reasonable accommodations for disabilities. I will
do everything in my capacity as your professor to ensure that you
receive those accommodations.

Students who need reasonable accommodations for disabilities also should
contact the Learning Assistance Center \& Disability Services
\href{https://lac.wfu.edu/}{lac.wfu.edu}. These accommodations are not
retroactive. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to use those
accommodations. You rightfully deserve them, both in the legal, moral,
and ethical sense.

\hypertarget{academic-dishonesty-policy}{%
\subsection{Academic Dishonesty
Policy}\label{academic-dishonesty-policy}}

All work submitted for credit must be the student's own and is subject
to the provisions of the Wake Forest Honor Code. Details can be found at
the Student Conduct web site:
\href{https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/honor-system-wfu/}{studentconduct.
wfu.edu/honor-system-wfu}. It is your responsibility to avoid even the
appearance of cheating.

Unless I have explicitly stated otherwise, every assessment is closed to
outside resources (including, but not limited to books, notes, phones,
people). Ignorance of the honor code and assignment instructions is not
an acceptable explanation and/or defense.

It is \emph{ALWAYS} academic dishonesty to share test questions, post
course materials on any third-party websites, or to work together on
tests. And frankly, it is really obvious in Canvas when you work
together. I literally wrote a R program that checks for working together
on tests.

Violations of this policy result in a zero for the assignment, my
perpetual disappointment, and possible additional penalties, including,
but not limited to: - a referral to honor council, - failing the class,
- forfeiting all extra credit, and - being excluding from the course
curve, drop policy, late policy, and extra credit.

\hypertarget{communication}{%
\subsection{Communication}\label{communication}}

I ask that you provide me with the respect that I should spend my time
engaging with students in meaningful ways, not pointing you to material
you can find on your own. Be sure to check the syllabus, course website,
course content, and classmates before emailing me. This is important
training for life after college -- when you have a question, the first
thing you do should not be to email your boss. I do not want to
discourage you from engaging with me. I love teaching because I love
interacting with students. However, I do not want to engage with you in
ways that nurture your inability to critically think and prevents me
from engaging with other students.

If you are ever uncertain about the purpose of an assignment, the
learning objectives of an activity, or how an assessment will be graded,
please reach out. My goal is to be organized, thoughtful, and
transparent. All my assignments were thoughtfully chosen. There is no
busy work or unnecessary required course material. If I have done a poor
job explaining the motivation for any aspect of my course, please let me
know so I can be more clear.

\hypertarget{minimums}{%
\subsubsection{Minimums}\label{minimums}}

You are expected to read every LMS announcement, message, and email; as
well as view the media embedded within those communications. Students
are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to
stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that
certain communications may be time-critical. At minimum, you should be
checking your communications within 24 hours. Ignorance of a class
communication is not grounds for an excused absence or extension.

\hypertarget{self-advocacy}{%
\subsubsection{Self Advocacy}\label{self-advocacy}}

If you are struggling in this class, please talk to me. Do not assume
that I know what is going on in your life. Talk to me and tell me what
you need.

\hypertarget{grading-questions}{%
\subsubsection{Grading Questions}\label{grading-questions}}

Please send any questions about grades in writing via email within
\emph{two} weeks after the assignment is returned. If I erred in scoring
or in calculating the grade, I will happily update the record.
Otherwise, I will be most receptive toward questions framed in terms of
your learning (rather than simply your performance), as research has
shown that focusing overly on extrinsic rewards (like grades) is likely
to lead to all sorts of outcomes that I don't wish for you (lower
interest in the course material, lower learning, lower enjoyment).

\hypertarget{instructor-availability}{%
\subsection{Instructor Availability}\label{instructor-availability}}

I am readily accessible during business hours (9:00AM-5:30PM;
Monday-Friday) via email/ LMS/ zoom/ carrier pigeon. Outside those
hours, I do not typically respond to messages, in order to devote time
to my family, rest, and living my life. Messages received during these
times will receive attention once I am back online. Otherwise you can
expect to receive a response to your message within 12 to 24 hours,
often much sooner. If you do not hear back after 36 hours, please
follow-up with me.

I have given out my cell-phone number, in the case of \emph{true}
emergencies. Please be mindful that poor planning on your part does not
constitute an emergency for me.

\hypertarget{is-it-an-true-emergency}{%
\subsubsection{Is it an true emergency?}\label{is-it-an-true-emergency}}

How do you know if it is a true emergency?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ask yourself, would a reasonable person consider this situation an
  emergency?
\item
  How would the situation change if you waited a until morning?
\item
  Could this situation have been prevented by starting earlier?
\item
  Would Professor Mason really want to know about this situation
  \emph{right} now?
\item
  If you were in Professor Mason's shoes, would you consider this an
  emergency?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{public-health-in-the-age-of-covid-19}{%
\section{Public Health in the age of
COVID-19}\label{public-health-in-the-age-of-covid-19}}

Each of us shares responsibility for the health and safety of all in a
learning space. Maintaining a consistent six feet of distance; wearing a
face covering; limiting our gathering sizes; and isolating or
quarantining when ill or exposed to someone with the virus are Wake
Forest University directives and policies we all must follow. Students
are encouraged to visit the Our Way Forward website
(ourwayforward.wfu.edu) to stay informed about the latest guidance and
review the
\href{https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/undergraduate-student-handbook/minimum_expectations/public-health-emergency-addendum/}{Public
Health Emergency Addendum to the Student Code of Conduct}.

Specifically, in this room, we will mitigate the risks of virus transfer
and take care of our community by abiding by the following safety
directives:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  maintain six feet of distance at all times when feasible.
\item
  wear a face covering for the entirety of class. This face covering
  should cover your mouth and your nose, and adhere to
  \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hc_yL-Pzec2TdfPTgrC18Cb96vympsbI/view}{our
  University face covering policy} (no face shields without masks; no
  neck gaiters; no bandanas; and no masks, including N95, with a one-way
  valve).
\item
  stay out of class when sick or after being exposed to someone who is
  sick.
\end{itemize}

In this class, any student who does not follow these requirements will
be asked once to follow the safety directives. I will offer you a mask
or ask you to find one. If you do not comply, I will ask you to leave
the class for that day.
\href{https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?WakeForestUniv\&layout_id=40}{I
will also refer the matter to the COVID-19 compliance reporting system.}
Possible disciplinary actions may follow as described in the Wake Forest
University Undergraduate Student Conduct Code Public Health Emergency
Addendum.

\hypertarget{classroom-climate}{%
\section{Classroom Climate}\label{classroom-climate}}

I aim to create a learning environment for my students that supports a
diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your
identities (including race, ethnicity, sex, gender, gender-identify,
class, sexual orientation, religion, ability, political affiliation,
etc.) To help accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that
  appear in your official records, please let me know!
\item
  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
  your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and
  talk with me. I want to be a resource for you.
\item
  I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse
  perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
  anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
\item
  If you reached here in the syllabus, e-mail me a picture of a cat. If
  you do it before the end of the first week, you get a small bonus.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{department-statement}{%
\subsection{Department Statement}\label{department-statement}}

The Psychology Department values, respects, and celebrates the
experiences, beliefs, and practices stemming from varied cultures and
circumstances (emphasizing, but not limited to, those from historically
underrepresented groups),and our deep commitment to diversity, equity,
and inclusion plays out through coursework, programming by majors, and
research.

\hypertarget{tentative-class-schedule}{%
\section{Tentative Class Schedule}\label{tentative-class-schedule}}

This syllabus is intended to give the student guidance in what may be
covered during the semester and will be followed as closely as possible.
Dates for tests and assignments won't change, barring extraordinary
events. However, I reserve the right to modify, supplement and make
changes as the course needs arise. I try to avoid changes to the
syllabus. Nevertheless, if changes occur, I will only make changes that
are less burdensome and more advantageous to the students. (If I make a
change that increases your burden, please talk to me.)
