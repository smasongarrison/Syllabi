# Academic Dishonesty Policy

All work submitted for credit must be the student's own and is subject to the provisions of the Wake Forest Honor Code. Details can be found at the Student Conduct web site: [studentconduct. wfu.edu/honor-system-wfu](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/honor-system-wfu/). It is your responsibility to avoid even the appearance of cheating.

Unless I have explicitly stated otherwise, every assessment is closed to outside resources (including, but not limited to books, notes, phones, people, Chegg, the internet). Ignorance of the honor code and assignment instructions is not an acceptable explanation and/or defense. 


## Violations

Violations of this policy result in a zero for the assignment, my perpetual disappointment, and possible additional penalties, including, but not limited to:

- a referral to honor council, 
- failing the class,
- a forensic regrading of all previous assessments,
- forfeiting all extra credit, and
- being excluded from the course curve, drop policy, late policy, and extra credit.




## Things that I thought didn't need to be said, but apparently did need to be said.

Everything must be in your own words, regardless of any open-resource policy. Open resources does not mean that you can copy and paste material from the outside sources. Assessments are not scavenger hunts. Assessments are a means for you to demonstrate your own understanding of the material. They are an opportunity to earn points through the demonstration of knowledge. 


### It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty...

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to share test questions.  

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to post course materials on any third-party websites. 

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to misrepresent others work as your own.  

It is *ALWAYS* academic dishonesty to work together on tests or quizzes. (And frankly, it is really obvious in Canvas when you work together. I literally wrote a R program that checks for working together on tests. )
