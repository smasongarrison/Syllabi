Welcome to all my syllabi! This website is designed to accompany all of Mason Garrisons courses at Wake Forest University. Over the semesters, I have found that my syllabi keep growing longer and longer as my career has progressed. I know that no one likes reading 8 page syllabi. However, I want to make sure that all my students know what my expectations are. So in that spirit, Ive created a website to contain all of my policies in one place. That way, I can have a neat and tidy syllabi, while still making my expectations clear. Mason Commentary This website is constantly changing.

Data Science for Psychologists (CN4P) introduces on the principles of data science, including: data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and communication. In this class, we link those principles to psychological methods and open science practices by emphasizing exploratory analyses and description, rather than confirmatory analyses and prediction. Through the semester we will work our way thru Wickham and Grolemunds R for Data Science text and develop proficiency with tidyverse. This class emphasizes replication and reproducibility. CN4P is a practical skilled-based class and should be useful to students aiming for academia as well as those interested in industry. Applications of these methods can be applied to a full range of psychological areas, including perception (e.g, eye-tracking data), neuroscience (e.g., visualizing neural networks), and individual differences (e.g., valence analysis). 0.1 Big Ideas This class covers the following broad five areas: Reproducibility; Replication; Robust Methods; Resplendent Visualizations; and R Programming. 0.2 Course Modality This class is a blended class. The online portions are asynchronous, and often contain pre-recorded videos. Ive created a video highlighting how to be a successful asynchronous learner. Much of this information comes from Northeastern Universitys Tips for Taking Online Classes 0.2.1 Productivity During Lockdown 0.3 Knowledge is Power This brief video is covers the icebreaker I do in all of my classes. I encourage you to watch it. In it, I discuss stereotype threats and statistics anxiety. 0.4 Meet Mason 0.5 Website Tour "],["syllabus.html", "Syllabus 0.6 Materials 0.7 Assignment Instructions", " Syllabus You can find the full syllabus on my syllabus git repo. 0.6 Materials 0.6.1 Hardware This class requires that you have a laptop that can run R. 0.6.2 Required Texts The text is intended to supplement the videos, lecture notes, tutorials, activities, and labs. You probably need to consume all of them in order to be successful in this class. R for Data Science text 0.6.3 Software 0.6.3.1 R and RStudio R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows, and MacOS. RStudio is a free integrated development environment (IDE), a powerful user interface for R. 0.6.3.2 Git and Github Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files  called a repository  in a structured way. Think of it like the Track Changes features from Microsoft Word. Github is a free IDE and hosting service for Git. As a Wake Forest student, you should be able to access the GitHub Student Developer Pack for free. It includes a free PRO upgrade for your github account. 0.7 Assignment Instructions 0.7.1 Portfolio EDA is like basketball. We can watch either being done, and appreciate the art and skill involved in high-level performance. In the hands of Lebron James or Michael Jordan, a basketball is a highly-tuned artistic instrument; in the hands of John Tukey, a graph sings the praises of data in melodies both harmonious and discordant, reflecting model, data, and mood. Part of this course will be devoted to Watching and Studying the master at his work. But basketball is played by thousands of bodies with less than NBA training and ability. Some novice basketball players are just learning their craft, and others will evolve into future LJs and MJs; others have lower aspirations, yet still enjoy participating. So also should EDA be played. A second part of this course will involve learning to do EDA by Doing It. Each of you will be expected to do several EDA projects. These projects will be done during EDA Labs in class, as well as during out-of-class effort. The nature of most of the particular projects will be entirely up to you. You will report to your instructor during EDA Labs on what you have been doing and what you plan to do. You will give a 15-minute individual presentation to the class at the end of the course on what you did in one or two of your major projects. Each project will require some data, to which EDA techniques will be applied. You are welcomed (in fact, strongly encouraged) to use data with which you are currently involved; dissertation or thesis data, a research project, the almanac, data from an article, data from EDA or VDat, data you collect from your family or friends, or data provided to you by your instructor are possible sources. 0.7.2 Additional Ground Rules In this class, I actively encourage you to double dip that is incorporate your research into portfolio pieces and use these pieces in other places. However, I Mason have some ground rules. These rules have been implemented for a variety of reasons, but primarily they are to preserve my sanity by establishing some boundaries. As much as I adore this class, my students (especially you, dear reader!), and everything it stands for  it blurs a lot of lines because often I serve numerous roles while teaching this class. In particular, I may also be your mentor, your committee member, your collaborator, your letter of recommendation writer, your colleague, your confidant, your statistics consultant, your friend, or cat care-taker. I do my best to navigate these roles as best I can. However, for my own sanity, here are my basic rules. For anything that is related to a graduate school milestone (thesis, first year project, major area paper) or something else that youre working with your advisor on you need to actively discuss it with your adviser and get their approval in advance. They may not  and thats okay. If theyre unsure, Im very happy to schedule a quick 30 minute chat with all three of us. My role on anything milestone related is to assist you with the implementation or give you general feedback. I cannot give you advice related to modeling or anything that would merit a discussion about authorship on the final work. I may disagree with something they recommend that you do such as use a specific software that isnt R. (I do have many strong opinions about SPSS and AMOS, as well as modeling choices. However, there is nearly always room for debate in these issues. I try to remind folks that my opinion is just that  an opinion.) For all things related to your research at Wake Forest, please defer to your advisor. Everyone in the department are amazing at what they do. Seriously, each is an expert in their research area  just as I am an expert in R (and genetically-informed designs and strange data). In all likelihood, they know more about the modeling in their specific area. I am very happy to share my expert opinions and I have the privilege to facilitate such conversations through the nature of this class. HOWEVER, please defer to your advisor for all design decisions. I will do my best to tell you when something is outside the scope of the class or if were approaching a gray area. I will not always be successful at navigating this issue. However, I will do my best to do so because I think it is worth the extra challenge. 0.7.2.1 Possible Projects Examples of appropriate portfolio pieces are listed below. I hope some or all of these will be worked on by members of the class. You should develop and work on your projects individually, but discussion with the instructor and others class members is encouraged and in fact expected. Draw plots by hand of some data that are of interest to you, and transform the variables in several different ways. Interpret your results. Choose some data from EDA or VDat; table or plot them in a way that Tukey/Cleveland didnt. Find some population data of interest to you (e.g., North Carolina, Forsyth County,your cat herd, etc.) and do several hand plots like those in Chapter 5 of EDA. Interpret results. Find some data in the World Almanac and plot and/or table them. Use some two-way data, and repeatedly extract the medians like Tukey does in Ch. 10 &amp; 11. Find some time series data, and smooth them in several different ways (see EDA, ch. 7). Data with seasonal patterns are especially interesting (see VDat, pp. 152-172). Write an R, SAS-Graph, SPSS, BASIC, FORTRAN, C, JAVA, or other program to portray influence-enhanced scatterplots. Produce scatterplots of several relationships. Write a BASIC, FORTRAN, C, SAS, SPSS, JAVA, or other program to portray scatter plots on a computer. Give the user the option to plot X and/or Y as either raw data, logs, squares, cubes, reciprocals, roots, etc. Write an R, SAS-Graph, SPSS, BASIC, FORTRAN, C, JAVA or other program to produce some exotic version of stem-and-leaf diagrams. Write a an R, SAS-Graph, SPSS, BASIC, FORTRAN, C, JAVA or other program to plot in three-dimensions with time as one of the dimensions (i.e., a kinostatistical plot). Use R or SAS-Graph or some other dedicated graphical package to plot some interesting data (preferably in color, possibly in 3D, maybe even in higher than 3D). Write an R/SAS routine to do median smoothing by three, and use it on some data. Write an R program, or SAS MACRO or SAS PROC or SAS program to produce some EDA output (but dont duplicate what PROC UNIVARIATE already does). Find an R program in the R library that does interesting EDA; apply it to some interesting data. Produce a correlation matrix between many variables, and develop a scatterplot matrix from it. Read the literature on graphical data analysis and develop some new graphical techniques. Program your techniques. Apply them to real data. Invent a new EDA graphical application, and apply it to real data.

At the end of the course, two things will happen. First, you will give a 12- to 15-minute asynchronous presentation in which you choose one of your EDA projects to describe to the class. Your description should include the goal of the project, the data you used, and a demonstration (PowerPoint, handout, holdup, computer demo, etc.) of the product. 2nd, you will turn in a Portfolio, which consists of two components: A report describing all your projects. The total number depends on the scope and difficulty of each project (as specified in your contract). There may be projects that you dont finish. Thats fine; EDA projects are hardly ever completely finished; write them up anyway. The projects should be numbered consecutively (i.e., in the order in which you began them), and should include for each project a description of the goal, the product (computer program, hand graph, computer graph, etc.), the data, and some interpretation. Reports must be Word Processed and of high quality in terms of writing, grammar, presentation, etc. A prototypical example of the product of each project (e.g., a graph, computer code, etc.). You may wish to put computer output into binders or appendices, graphs into report folders, etc. Portfolios will not be returned; if you wish to have a copy, make one before you turn it in. Portfolios are due the last week of class. Project reports will not be accepted late. Please, no exceptions!!! 0.7.2.3 What is an unessay? An unessay is exactly what the name sounds like. It is not an essay (although it can be one if youd like). What it is is a means to highlight what you have learned. In this class, effectively what that means is that you get to select either a specific portfolio piece or perhaps several of them to highlight what you have learned in this class. 0.7.2.3.1 What makes a good unessay? A good unessay constitutes a critical and active engagement with the course material that shows insight and creativity and demonstrates time and effort devoted to creating something thoughtful. The chosen medium works persuasively with the design and polish of the unessay. The projects structural and formal elements productively serve the core concept of the unessay. The unessay includes a clear and insightful connection between your three choices and reflects a convincing and nuanced thesis. An A unessay come with a clearly stated explanation. This will include your thesis and an explanation of how your unessay responds to the prompt. 0.7.2.4 More Information about contract grading https://marckissel.netlify.app/post/on-the-unessay/ https://esclark.hcommons.org/the-unessay/ https://ryancordell.org/teaching/how-not-to-teach-digital-humanities/ "],["personality.html", "255: Personality 0.8 Course Description 0.9 Required Materials 0.10 Course Assignments 0.11 Grading Policy 0.12 Week 01, 08/24 - 08/28 : Introduction and What is Personality 0.13 Week 02, 08/31 - 09/04 : Research Design in Personality 0.14 Week 03, 09/07 - 09/11 : Personality Assessment and Testing Controversies 0.15 Week 04, 09/14 - 09/18 : How do people differ?

These activities will allow you engage with the material for each module. Details about the specific activities will be provided on canvas. Students must complete two activities per module. For students in the blended section, they can attend their weekly in-person session and count it as an engagement activity. 0.11 Grading Policy Typically, an A- is defined as 90% of the highest point total in the class, B- as 80% of that total, C- as 70 and D- as 60%. I may shift these values down to provide a better fit to the actual point distribution. By scaling to a percentage of the highest point total in the class, each student has a much better chance of receiving higher grades than if no re-scaling were done. This curve can only help your grade.

For tests and other assignments, I try to provide a projected letter grade. This projected letter grade is there to give you a sense of what your score would be if I implemented the class curve on this particular assignment. It is a projection. It is not a guarantee. These projected letter grades are not incorporated into your final grade. Trust me, you do not want me to curve by assignment. 200 points of your grade will be determined by your best two exams. The final is not optional. 50 points of your grade will be determined by completing engagement activities. 100 points of your grade will be determined by your best two short assignments. 0.12 Week 01, 08/24 - 08/28 : Introduction and What is Personality 0.13 Week 02, 08/31 - 09/04 : Research Design in Personality 0.14 Week 03, 09/07 - 09/11 : Personality Assessment and Testing Controversies 0.15 Week 04, 09/14 - 09/18 : How do people differ?

"],["grading-policy-1.html", "4 Grading Policy 4.1 Contract Details 4.2 What About Exceptional (or Mediocre) Work? 4.3 Contract Adjustments 4.4 Contract Grades", " 4 Grading Policy In this course, you will determine the grade you receive by fulfilling a contract you will submit for my approval on 02/05. Your written contract will detail: The requirements you will meet in order to receive the grade for which youve contracted, the penalties you will incur for not meeting those requirements, a calendar you will follow for meeting the requirements you have outlined. Many aspects of this calendar will be determined by windows outlined on the course schedule, but your contract will take ownership of these deadlines while committing to specific due dates for the courses more flexible assignments. 4.1 Contract Details To fulfill any grade contract a student must do the following, which should nonetheless be specified in the contract submitted for approval. When writing self-assessments students must describe how they have met these requirements in addition to the grade-specific requirements: Come to class prepared to discuss any assigned readings, videos, or other media. Participate actively in class activities and discussions, making observations and asking questions that help the class think together. Meet with me in personduring office hours or another scheduled timeat least once around midtermroughly between weeks 5-8 to ensure you are on-track to meet your contract requirements, discuss any questions or concerns you have about the course or your progress, and decide on any necessary contract amendments. Revise contractual assignments as necessary until both you and I consider them Satisfactory. Complete a final self-assessment demonstrating that your work has met the agreed requirements, submitting it to me by 5pm on the last day of class. The professor reserves the right to award a grade of D or F to anyone who fails to meet a contractual obligation in a systematic way. A D grade denotes some minimal fulfilling of the contract. An F is absence of enough satisfactory work, as contracted, to warrant passing of the course. Both a D and F denote a breakdown of the contractual relationship implied by signing any of the contracts described above. 4.2 What About Exceptional (or Mediocre) Work? I also reserve the right to reward exceptional work throughout the semester using the full range of Wake Forests grading scale. If you contract for a B, for instance, and submit particularly strong pieces to fulfill that contract, I may elect to raise your contracted grade to a B+. Likewise, if you consistently submit mediocre work in fulfillment of your contract, I reserve the right to adjust your grade one half-step down (e.g. from A to A-) or even, in extreme cases, a full step. 4.3 Contract Adjustments Periodically during the semester I will ask you to evaluate your work thus far and compare it against what you agreed in your grade contract. In these moments you can also take the opportunity to request an adjustment to your contract in either direction. If you find that you will be unable to meet the obligations of your contract, you may request to move to the next lowest grade and its requirements. Contrariwise, if you find that youve been performing above the obligations of your contract, you may request to fulfill the requirements for the next higher grade. Important Note: In order to effectively evaluate your own progress, you must keep track of your work, including days missed, and so forth. 4.4 Contract Grades 4.4.1 A Contract To contract for an A in this course, you agree to: Earn Satisfactory on 11 self-paced lab assignments on a schedule you will specify in your contract. Produce at least 10 Satisfactory portfolio pieces over the course of the semester. Complete two Satisfactory Unessays on a schedule you will specify in your contract and present the strongest as an asynchronous presentation. 4.4.2 B+ Contract To contract for an B in this course, you agree to: Earn Satisfactory on 10 self-paced lab assignments on a schedule you will specify in your contract.

In previous semesters, I have had a deliberately hardline attendance policy. In the light of the public health crisis, I have done away with the this policy, as it doesnt align with my general philosophy of treating students as junior colleagues. The student who misses a class meeting is responsible for any assignments and/or announcements made. Class engagement points are given to encourage your active engagement with the material. Specific instructions for engagement, can be found on the class website In general, you will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you engage meaningfully and intentionally with the material and your peers. 5.2 Life Happens (Extensions and Absences) As a reasonable and empathetic human, I recognize that life happens. There will be times when your outside life conflicts with scheduled class events. These life events can be any of the obvious things (sports, religious holidays, illness, interviews, etc), but they can also be the less obvious, like spending the entire night looking for your lost pet. My general approach is to work with you. You just need to let me know ahead of time. These late policies value discussion and communication over deductions and punishment. It is difficult for me as an instructor to know your situation and reason for lateness (e.g. are you sick? did you lose wifi? struggling with mental health? or just forgot?). Without communication, I will assume that students are choosing not to submit work and do not plan on submitting work. An email will help me better understand your needs and focus on coursework. Im more than happy to give extensions and accommodations, so dont be afraid to email me. You dont need to disclose personal details (your privacy is important to me), so a heads up or request for assistance is enough. 5.2.1 Excused absences Except in the case of true emergencies, a possible excused absence should be discussed with me as far in advance as possible and must occur beforehand. You should not assume that an excused absence will automatically be granted  but you may assume that I am a reasonable, empathetic person. This discussion should occur via email. If you also discuss your situation verbally, please send a summary of the discussion via email to me. An unexcused absence will result in a zero for any graded work that should have been performed for or during the missed class. 5.2.2 Late Work Be sure to pay close attention to deadlines. If an assignment is not submitted by the deadline (i.e., is late), the student must email the instructor and provide a new deadline, ask for an alternative, or explain concerns within 36 hours of the missed deadline. Ideally, you will have communicated with me in advance of the deadline, but on occasion life happens. As long as youve communicated within 36 hours, I will do my best to work with you to come up with a new deadline or modification, so that you can receive full credit. This late policy does not apply to exams, tests, or quizzes. If contact is not made within 36 hours of the missed deadline, the missing assignment will receive a 0. Alternative deadlines will be within one week of the original deadline. Exceptions to the 1 week policy are at the instructors discretion. In general, I will be much more sympathetic and accommodating if you communicate in advance. It is your responsibility to ensure that the instructor has received the assignment by the established due date and to ensure that the assignment submitted is the complete and correct version. Unless otherwise specified, all work must be submitted through Canvas. Unless you have communicated with me in advance, there will be no make-up quizzes or tests. 5.3 Accommodations Policy If you are (or become) disabled (in any capacity, permanently, or temporarily), and need accommodations in class, reading, or any other work in this course, please contact me to discuss your specific needs as soon as possible. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, you are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations for disabilities. I will do everything in my capacity as your professor to ensure that you receive those accommodations. Students who need reasonable accommodations for disabilities also should contact the Learning Assistance Center &amp; Disability Services lac.wfu.edu. These accommodations are not retroactive. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to use those accommodations. You rightfully deserve them, both in the legal, moral, and ethical sense. 5.4 Academic Dishonesty Policy All work submitted for credit must be the students own and is subject to the provisions of the Wake Forest Honor Code. Details can be found at the Student Conduct web site: studentconduct. wfu.edu/honor-system-wfu. It is your responsibility to avoid even the appearance of cheating. Unless I have explicitly stated otherwise, every assessment is closed to outside resources (including, but not limited to books, notes, phones, people). Ignorance of the honor code and assignment instructions is not an acceptable explanation and/or defense. It is ALWAYS academic dishonesty to share test questions, post course materials on any third-party websites, or to work together on tests. And frankly, it is really obvious in Canvas when you work together. I literally wrote a R program that checks for working together on tests. Violations of this policy result in a zero for the assignment, my perpetual disappointment, and possible additional penalties, including, but not limited to: a referral to honor council, failing the class, forfeiting all extra credit, and being excluding from the course curve, drop policy, late policy, and extra credit. 5.5 Communication I ask that you provide me with the respect that I should spend my time engaging with students in meaningful ways, not pointing you to material you can find on your own. Be sure to check the syllabus, course website, course content, and classmates before emailing me. This is important training for life after college  when you have a question, the first thing you do should not be to email your boss. I do not want to discourage you from engaging with me. I love teaching because I love interacting with students. However, I do not want to engage with you in ways that nurture your inability to critically think and prevents me from engaging with other students. 5.5.1 Minimums You are expected to read every LMS announcement, message, and email; as well as view the media embedded within those communications. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. At minimum, you should be checking your communications within 24 hours. Ignorance of a class communication is not grounds for an excused absence or extension. 5.5.2 Self Advocacy If you are struggling in this class, please talk to me. Do not assume that I know what is going on in your life. Talk to me and tell me what you need. 5.5.3 Grading Questions Please send any questions about grades in writing via email within two weeks after the assignment is returned. If I erred in scoring or in calculating the grade, I will happily update the record. Otherwise, I will be most receptive toward questions framed in terms of your learning (rather than simply your performance), as research has shown that focusing overly on extrinsic rewards (like grades) is likely to lead to all sorts of outcomes that I dont wish for you (lower interest in the course material, lower learning, lower enjoyment). 5.6 Instructor Availability I am readily accessible during business hours (9:00AM-5:30PM; Monday-Friday) via email/ LMS/ git/ zoom/ carrier pigeon. Outside those hours, I do not typically respond to messages, in order to devote time to my family, rest, and living my life. Messages received during these times will receive attention once I am back online. Otherwise you can expect to receive a response to your message within 12 to 24 hours, often much sooner. If you do not hear back after 36 hours, please follow-up with me. I have given out my cell-phone number, in the case of true emergencies. Please be mindful that poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency for me. 5.6.1 Is it an true emergency? How do you know if it is a true emergency? Ask yourself, would a reasonable person consider this situation an emergency? How would the situation change if you waited a until morning? Could this situation have been prevented by starting earlier? Would Professor Mason really want to know about this situation right now? If you were in Professor Masons shoes, would you consider this an emergency?

The purpose of the course is to provide students with an understanding of the principles of measurement as applied to group standardized measures of achievement, special aptitude, intelligence, personality, interests and distress for use in counseling. Format will consist primarily of lectures along with group participation activities. 9.1 Course Objectives: To acquaint you with the fundamental vocabulary and logic of psychological measurement and behavioral assessment. To develop your capacity for critical judgment of the adequacy of measures purported to assess behavior in the role of theory development. To acquaint you with some of the relevant literature in personality assessment, psychometric theory and practice, and methods of observing and measuring behavior. To instill in you an appreciation of and an interest in the principles and methods of psychometric theory in general and behavior assessment in particular. This course is not designed to make you into an accomplished psychometrist (one who gives tests) nor is it designed to make you a skilled psychometrician (one who constructs tests), nor will it give you hands on experience with psychometric computer programs. Rather it is aimed to allow you to understand the fundamental theoretical issues concerning both the psychometrist and the psychometrician. Because modern psychometrics and statistics may be done using open source software such as R, examples will be presented in R.

I may shift these values down to provide a better fit to the actual point distribution. By scaling to a percentage of the highest point total in the class, each student has a much better chance of receiving higher grades than if no re-scaling were done. This curve can only help your grade.

These projected letter grades are not incorporated into your final grade. Trust me, you do not want me to curve by assignment. 11.2 Quizzes There will be 6 quizzes in this course.

Each assignment has a qualitative aspect and a quantitative aspect, and are counted separately in your grade. The best two (2) out of three (3) qualitative aspects will be used to determine your qualitative score; similarly, the best two (2) out of three (3) quantitative aspects will be used to determine your quantitative score. I will provide more specific written guidelines at least two weeks before each assignment is due. You have to submit assignment 1 because I give extensive feedback that will help you on later assignments.

In previous semesters, I have had a deliberately hardline attendance policy. In the light of the public health crisis, I have done away with the this policy, as it doesnt align with my general philosophy of treating students as junior colleagues. The student who misses a class meeting is responsible for any assignments and/or announcements made. Class engagement points are given to encourage your active engagement with the material. Specific instructions for engagement, can be found on the class website In general, you will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you engage meaningfully and intentionally with the material and your peers. 12.2 Life Happens (Extensions and Absences) As a reasonable and empathetic human, I recognize that life happens. There will be times when your outside life conflicts with scheduled class events. These life events can be any of the obvious things (sports, religious holidays, illness, interviews, etc), but they can also be the less obvious, like spending the entire night looking for your lost pet. My general approach is to work with you. You just need to let me know ahead of time. These late policies value discussion and communication over deductions and punishment. It is difficult for me as an instructor to know your situation and reason for lateness (e.g. are you sick? did you lose wifi? struggling with mental health? or just forgot?). Without communication, I will assume that students are choosing not to submit work and do not plan on submitting work. An email will help me better understand your needs and focus on coursework. Im more than happy to give extensions and accommodations, so dont be afraid to email me. You dont need to disclose personal details (your privacy is important to me), so a heads up or request for assistance is enough. 12.2.1 Excused absences Except in the case of true emergencies, a possible excused absence should be discussed with me as far in advance as possible and must occur beforehand. You should not assume that an excused absence will automatically be granted  but you may assume that I am a reasonable, empathetic person. This discussion should occur via email. If you also discuss your situation verbally, please send a summary of the discussion via email to me. An unexcused absence will result in a zero for any graded work that should have been performed for or during the missed class. 12.2.2 Late Work Be sure to pay close attention to deadlines. If an assignment is not submitted by the deadline (i.e., is late), the student must email the instructor and provide a new deadline, ask for an alternative, or explain concerns within 36 hours of the missed deadline. Ideally, you will have communicated with me in advance of the deadline, but on occasion life happens. As long as youve communicated within 36 hours, I will do my best to work with you to come up with a new deadline or modification, so that you can receive full credit. This late policy does not apply to exams, tests, or quizzes. If contact is not made within 36 hours of the missed deadline, the missing assignment will receive a 0. Alternative deadlines will be within one week of the original deadline. Exceptions to the 1 week policy are at the instructors discretion. In general, I will be much more sympathetic and accommodating if you communicate in advance. It is your responsibility to ensure that the instructor has received the assignment by the established due date and to ensure that the assignment submitted is the complete and correct version. Unless otherwise specified, all work must be submitted through Canvas. Unless you have communicated with me in advance, there will be no make-up quizzes or tests. 12.3 Accommodations Policy If you are (or become) disabled (in any capacity, permanently, or temporarily), and need accommodations in class, reading, or any other work in this course, please contact me to discuss your specific needs as soon as possible. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, you are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations for disabilities. I will do everything in my capacity as your professor to ensure that you receive those accommodations. Students who need reasonable accommodations for disabilities also should contact the Learning Assistance Center &amp; Disability Services lac.wfu.edu. These accommodations are not retroactive. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to use those accommodations. You rightfully deserve them, both in the legal, moral, and ethical sense. 12.4 Academic Dishonesty Policy All work submitted for credit must be the students own and is subject to the provisions of the Wake Forest Honor Code. Details can be found at the Student Conduct web site: studentconduct. wfu.edu/honor-system-wfu. It is your responsibility to avoid even the appearance of cheating. Unless I have explicitly stated otherwise, every assessment is closed to outside resources (including, but not limited to books, notes, phones, people). Ignorance of the honor code and assignment instructions is not an acceptable explanation and/or defense. It is ALWAYS academic dishonesty to share test questions, post course materials on any third-party websites, or to work together on tests.

Violations of this policy result in a zero for the assignment, my perpetual disappointment, and possible additional penalties, including, but not limited to: a referral to honor council, failing the class, forfeiting all extra credit, and being excluding from the course curve, drop policy, late policy, and extra credit. 12.5 Communication I ask that you provide me with the respect that I should spend my time engaging with students in meaningful ways, not pointing you to material you can find on your own. Be sure to check the syllabus, course website, course content, and classmates before emailing me.

At minimum, you should be checking your communications within 24 hours. Ignorance of a class communication is not grounds for an excused absence or extension. 12.5.2 Self Advocacy If you are struggling in this class, please talk to me. Do not assume that I know what is going on in your life. Talk to me and tell me what you need. 12.5.3 Grading Questions Please send any questions about grades in writing via email within two weeks after the assignment is returned. If I erred in scoring or in calculating the grade, I will happily update the record.

Link Preview What is Data Science @ Oreilly Data scientists combine entrepreneurship with patience, the willingness to build data products incrementally, the ability to explore, and the ability to iterate over a solution. They are inherently interdiscplinary. They can tackle all aspects of a problem, from initial data collection and data conditioning to drawing conclusions. They can think outside the box to come up with new ways to view the problem, or to work with very broadly defined problems: heres a lot of data, what can you make from it? What is Data Science @ Quora Data Science is a combination of a number of aspects of Data such as Technology, Algorithm development, and data interference to study the data, analyze it, and find innovative solutions to difficult problems. Basically Data Science is all about Analyzing data and driving for business growth by finding creative ways. The sexiest job of 21st century Data scientists today are akin to Wall Street quants of the 1980s and 1990s. In those days people with backgrounds in physics and math streamed to investment banks and hedge funds, where they could devise entirely new algorithms and data strategies. Then a variety of universities developed masters programs in financial engineering, which churned out a second generation of talent that was more accessible to mainstream firms. The pattern was repeated later in the 1990s with search engineers, whose rarefied skills soon came to be taught in computer science programs. Wikipedia Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data. How to Become a Data Scientist Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. A data scientists role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations. a very short history of #datascience The story of how data scientists became sexy is mostly the story of the coupling of the mature discipline of statistics with a very young onecomputer science. The term Data Science has emerged only recently to specifically designate a new profession that is expected to make sense of the vast stores of big data. But making sense of data has a long history and has been discussed by scientists, statisticians, librarians, computer scientists and others for years. The following timeline traces the evolution of the term Data Science and its use, attempts to define it, and related terms. 18.2 Course structure and some other useful things You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below.

You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. I recommend installing R, Rstudio, git, and github before starting activity 02 20.1 R and RStudio 20.1.1 Install R and RStudio library(vembedr) embed_url(&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVIZGCT5p9U&quot;) %&gt;% use_align(&quot;center&quot;) Install R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system  use the links up at the top of the CRAN page linked above! Install RStudios IDE (stands for integrated development environment), a powerful user interface for R. Get the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop. You can run either the Preview version or the official releases available here. RStudio comes with a text editor, so there is no immediate need to install a separate stand-alone editor. RStudio can interface with Git(Hub). However, you must do all the Git(Hub) set up described elsewhere before you can take advantage of this. If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, I highly recommend that you reinstall both and get as current as possible. It can be considerably harder to run old software than new. If you upgrade R, you will need to update any packages you have installed. The command below should get you started, though you may need to specify more arguments if, e.g., you have been using a non-default library for your packages. update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE) Note: this code will only look for updates on CRAN. So if you use a package that lives only on GitHub or if you want a development version from GitHub, you will need to update manually, e.g. via devtools::install_github(). 20.1.2 Testing testing Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see here, but yours will be more boring because you havent written any code or made any figures yet! Put your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code like x &lt;- 3 * 4 (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the x object by typing x followed by enter or return. You should see the value 12 print to screen. If yes, youve succeeded in installing R and RStudio. 20.1.3 Add-on packages R is an extensible system and many people share useful code they have developed as a package via CRAN and GitHub. To install a package from CRAN, for example the dplyr package for data manipulation, here is one way to do it in the R console (there are others). install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;, dependencies = TRUE) By including dependencies = TRUE, we are being explicit and extra-careful to install any additional packages the target package, dplyr in the example above, needs to have around. You could use the above method to install the following packages, all of which we will use: tidyr, package webpage ggplot2, package webpage 20.1.4 Further resources The above will get your basic setup ready but here are some links if you are interested in reading a bit further.

The compiled version should look something like the following "],["thoughtful-workflow.html", "22 Thoughtful Workflow 22.1 R Markdown 22.2 Git and Github 22.3 Getting Help with R", " 22 Thoughtful Workflow At this point, I recommend you pause and think about your workflow. I give you permission to spend some time and energy sorting this out! It can be as or more important than learning a new R function or package. The experts dont talk about this much, because theyve already got a workflow; its something they do almost without thinking. Working through subsequent material in R Markdown documents, possibly using Git and GitHub to track and share your progress, is a great idea and will leave you more prepared for your future data analysis projects. Typing individual lines of R code is but a small part of data analysis and it pays off to think holistically about your workflow. If you want a lot more detail on workflows, you can wander over to the optional bit on r basics and workflow. 22.1 R Markdown If you are in the mood to be entertained, start the video from the beginning. But if youd rather just get on with it, start watching at 6:52. You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. R Markdown is a very accessible way to create computational documents that combine prose and tables and figures produced by R code. An introductory R Markdown workflow, including how it intersects with Git, GitHub, and RStudio, is now maintained within the Happy Git site: Test drive R Markdown 22.2 Git and Github XKCD on Git First, its important to realize that Git and GitHub are distinct things. GitHub is an online hosting platform that provides an array of services built on top of the Git system. (Similar platforms include Bitbucket and GitLab.) Just like we dont need Rstudio to run R code, we dont need GitHub to use Git But, it will make our lives so much easier. I recommend checking out Jenny Bryans instructions around installation, setup, and early Git usage with her book Happy Git with R. I have provided a optional deep dive in a later chapter](#happygit). You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below. 22.2.1 What is Github? 22.2.2 Git Git is a distributed version control system. (Wait, what?) Okay, try this: Imagine if Dropbox and the Track changes feature in MS Word had a baby. Git would be that baby. In fact, its even better than that because Git is optimized for the things that social scientists and data scientists spend a lot of time working on (e.g. code). The learning curve is worth it  I promise you. Git and GitHubs role in global software development is not in question. - Theres a high probability that your favorite app, program or package is built using Git-based tools. (RStudio is a case in point.) Scientists and academic researchers are cottoning on too. Benefits of version control and collaboration tools aside, Git(Hub) helps to operationalize the ideals of open science and reproducibility. Journals have increasingly strict requirements regarding reproducibility and data access. GH makes this easy (DOI integration, off-the-shelf licenses, etc.). I run my entire lab on GH; this entire course is running on github; these lecture notes are hosted on github 22.3 Getting Help with R You can follow along with the slides here if they do not appear below.

Why do they do this? I do not know and this it is a silly policy. Regardless, before you lose access to your WFU email, you need to add a 2nd email address to your github account. Otherwise you will not be able to get access to your materials after you graduate. Github has some incredibly useful guides to do this How to add an email address to your github account Hot to change your primary email address [How to set up a backup email address] (https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-a-backup-email-address) Please do not procrastinate this!
